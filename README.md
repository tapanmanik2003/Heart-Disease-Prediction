# Heart Disease Prediction Project
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting heart disease using demographic and health data. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Overview
Heart disease is a significant health concern worldwide. Predicting the likelihood of heart disease can aid in early diagnosis and intervention. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the probability of heart disease based on various demographic and health factors.

## Project Structure
data/: Directory containing the dataset files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
scripts/: Python scripts for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.
README.md: Project overview and instructions.
## Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting relevant features for modeling.
Model Building: Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-Validation: Addressing overfitting by performing cross-validation and selecting the best-performing model.
